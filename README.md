## Description

  This homework for the Northwestern Coding Boot Camp was a code refactor for a simple note taking app that is deployed on Heroku.

  [Deployed App](https://secret-everglades-66954.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

  This app is useful as it stores the notes in heroku to be retrieved later, as well as the feature to delete notes when they aren't useful anymore. It uses clearly labelled buttons to add to the functionality.
